## Gates

- Before you finish, run `npm run check:changed`. It is the same check the stop hook runs.
- The full gate is `env -u ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE npm test`; CI runs it on every pull request.
- While iterating, `env -u ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE npm test -- <suite>` runs only the named suites:
  incremental builds, no clean, no whole-tree checks. It never replaces the full gate.
- `docs/enforcement.md` maps every AGENTS.md rule to the check that holds it.
