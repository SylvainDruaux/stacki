// An `if`, and what the tree draws under it.
//
// A condition's branches are real nodes in the model — `{x ? (…) : (…)}` has a
// then and an else, and the markup for each has to live somewhere. But a THEN
// is not a place. It is what the `if` above it already said, so the row read
// "then" under "if href", indented everything inside it a level for saying
// nothing, and cost a line and a chevron on the way to the markup.
//
// So the then is never drawn. What is inside it is drawn inside the `if`, a
// level shallower. An else keeps its row: it is the one branch that says
// something the `if` doesn't, and without a row of its own there would be no
// telling which children belonged to which side.
//
// The model is untouched either way — the branch is still where a drop lands,
// still what the file writes out. This is only which rows the tree draws.
