// One run in flight and at most one waiting behind it (plan §7, §11.9: one
// read per tick). A caller that asks while a run is under way is answered by
// the next run, which starts only after the running one ends — so every answer
// comes from a run that began after its caller asked, and a burst of any size
// costs at most two runs. This replaces the rescan chain and the panels' drain
// loops, which followed newer requests in a loop capped by rescanChainMax and
// saveDrainMax: there is no loop left to cap. Each run is one tick, started by
// a request, and the requests that arrive while one waits share its answer.
