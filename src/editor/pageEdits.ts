// The persistence layer's edit queue (plan §2 layer 3, §7, §11.9): what the
// open page owes the disk, in the order the user made it, and how each part
// reaches the page's actor.
//
// Two kinds of entry, never mixed up:
//   - a gesture (any page — .astro, Markdown or MDX since step 10): the edit
//     requests it becomes, stated when it is sent — against the page as the
//     app's last reply left it (the origin), so a node an earlier gesture
//     created a moment ago is already there to name. A request names nodes by
//     the facts of that parse (path, kind, source range), and main checks them
//     against its own projection of the same bytes. Nothing is saved as a
//     whole model: when specialized syntax cannot state a gesture, the
//     smallest stable node changed by its model effect is rewritten instead.
//   - typed code (step 8): the page's text, saved as one patch from the
//     baseline the typing descends from (src/editor/codeEdits.ts). At most one, and
//     first: typing replaces the unsent gestures, which the text it was typed
//     into does not hold.
//
// The rules (plan §7): gestures coalesce within one stream (one field of one
// node) and one undo step while unsent — the last value wins; the queue is
// bounded (LIMITS.intentsPendingMax), and a gesture past it is refused, never
// queued; a refusal never destroys input — the entry stays queued and the
// page's conflict notice names the reason.
//
// Undo steps (EditsRecord) learn their inverses as replies arrive. An entry
// carrying several steps' bytes in one write (typing) gives its inverse to the
// newest step; the older ones are `folded` into it.
