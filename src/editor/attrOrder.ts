// The order a tag's attributes are written in.
//
// It belongs to the file. The model keeps it as a list of names on the node —
// `attrOrder`, written down when the page is read — because an object only
// remembers the order its keys were added, and that stops being the file's
// order the moment a prop is taken out and put back. The writer follows the
// list: what the file had, where it had it, then anything added since.
//
// Which leaves the one edit that changes a name rather than a value. Renaming
// an attribute keeps the value and the slot; the list is by name, so the name
// has to change there too, or the prop leaves for the end of the tag on its
// way to being called something else.

// A prop renamed in place: the props and their order after the rename, or
// undefined when there is nothing to rename. A name the tag already had gives
// up its slot to the rename — that is what overwriting it means. Pure: the
// node is left as it was (plan §11.9 — the model is never edited in place).
// Values are opaque: renaming must retain all serializer metadata by identity.
