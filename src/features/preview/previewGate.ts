// Which canvas events the editor acts on (plan §9, step 7; invariant 6 of §10:
// a stale preview cannot submit a silently remapped edit).
//
// A click names a node by its index path in the rendering the canvas shows. The
// editor selects that path in the model IT shows, and every edit after that is
// authored against the editor's page — so if the rendering came from other
// bytes, the click would select whatever node now sits at that path, and the
// edit would apply to it, silently. The gate accepts an event only when:
//
//   1. its token is the frame's latest rendering (the frame did not re-render
//      under the pointer);
//   2. the file open for editing rendered from the bytes the editor shows — a
//      clean page's own checksum, or, while edits are unsaved, the origin the
//      shown model was cloned from, as long as those edits left every path
//      meaning the same node (text typed, not a node moved);
//   3. every file that rendered — page, layouts, components — still holds the
//      bytes its stamp names on disk (main reads them: preview:check).
//
// Hover is a picture, not a selection: it needs (1) only, so it never waits.
