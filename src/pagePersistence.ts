// The page saver (plan §7, §11.9): the open page's queue (src/pageEdits.ts)
// sent to its actor, one entry at a time, in order. The queue is the only
// record of what is unsaved — nothing tracks which state object was written —
// and one flush sends the entries it finds when it starts: an edit made while
// it runs is queued behind them and has its own save scheduled, so there is no
// drain loop to bound. Flushes run one at a time (src/coalescedRun.ts), and a
// caller is answered by a flush that began after it asked: everything queued
// before the call has been sent, or a refusal is holding it back.
//
// Every write names the checksum it was authored against, and a refusal (the
// file changed on disk) stops autosave instead of retrying (plan §7).
