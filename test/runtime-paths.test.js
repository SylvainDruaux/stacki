// Goal: every file the main process loads at run time is where it looks. The
// paths live in one module, electron/lib/runtimePaths.ts, written as the build
// output they name; a move that left one behind would break the packaged app
// only when that file was first needed.
// Method: load the built module and check that each path it returns exists
// in the build, and that the asar rewrite leaves an unpackaged path alone.
