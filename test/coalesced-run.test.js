// Goal: src/coalescedRun.ts keeps its one promise — a request is answered by a
// run that began no earlier than the request — with one run in flight and at
// most one waiting, so a burst of any size costs at most two runs. It replaced
// the rescan chain and the panels' drain loops (plan §11.9), which followed
// newer requests in a loop capped by rescanChainMax and saveDrainMax.
// Method: runs are deferred promises the test settles by hand, so every
// interleaving below is explicit; no timers.
