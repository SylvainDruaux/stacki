// Getting the preview back after a compile error.
//
//   node test/renderer/preview/previewRecovery.test.js
//
// A compile error replaces the site with the dev server's error screen. That
// screen has no HMR client in it, so when the mistake is fixed nothing tells it
// — the preview goes on showing the error until someone presses refresh. So the
// app asks the dev server whether it is serving a page again, and reloads the
// frame when it is.
//
// Two ways for that to be quietly wrong, and both look like a working feature:
//
//   Reload too eagerly — on every probe rather than on the not-serving →
//   serving edge — and every edit becomes a full page reload, throwing away the
//   live patching the app does instead.
//
//   Ask once and give up. A fix takes a moment to compile, so the first ask
//   almost always lands while the error is still there; a watch that doesn't
//   come back leaves the preview stuck exactly as before.
//
//   Never ask at all. The poll only starts once a probe has FAILED, so
//   something has to ask the first question — and the app said "the site may
//   have changed" only for the file kinds it edits itself. Break a .ts a
//   component imports, in an editor, and the preview goes to the error screen
//   with nothing that will ever ask again.
//
// The probe half is checked against a real HTTP server, because the thing being
// relied on is what a 500 and an unreachable port actually do.
