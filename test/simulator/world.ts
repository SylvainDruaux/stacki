// The deterministic simulation (plan §10). One World holds a fake disk, one
// actor per file, and the client's view of each file. Every step the seeded
// PRNG picks one event — a visual intent, a stale preview intent, a Markdown
// block intent (step 10: text typed, a block or item removed, inserted or
// moved) fresh or from a stale preview, an oracle gesture, a code-editor save
// (a patch, since step 8, often leaving the file invalid), a whole-model save,
// an external manual edit, a pasted copy of a line, an attribute added in
// another editor, an AI-style rewrite, a git-style atomic replacement, a
// watcher tick, an actor step, a crash, a disk failure, a submission burst —
// applies it, and checks the invariants.
//
// Determinism is structural, not careful: the scheduler is the only source of
// order, the PRNG the only source of choice, the disk is in memory, and there
// is no timer, promise or clock anywhere under test/simulator/ (the lint gate
// enforces that). The trace of one seed is therefore a pure function of the
// seed and the fixtures, and its digest proves it (invariant 9).
//
// From step 3 the actor plans set-attribute with the shipping planner, mapped
// through the diff when the intent is stale (engine-planner.ts). Every writer
// here also records where each byte came from (provenance.ts), and every stale
// set-attribute decision is judged against those origins (remap-judge.ts): a
// plan at any other element than the one the authored element became fails the
// run (`wrongSite: 'fail'`, the gate) or is counted (`'count'`, the spike
// report). The judgements are tallied per file.
