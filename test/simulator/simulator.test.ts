// Goal: the simulator runs seeded scenarios over the hostile corpus and a
// slice of the round-trip corpus, every invariant holds after every event, and
// a seed reproduces its run exactly (plan §10, invariant 9). From step 3 the
// actor plans set-attribute with the shipping planner, so stale intents are
// remapped through the diff, and every remap is judged against the byte
// origins the simulator recorded: a wrong-site plan fails the run at the event.
// Method: the entry points are the only files under test/simulator/ that touch
// the filesystem — fixtures.entry.ts loads the fixture texts and hands them to
// runSimulation, which is pure. Each gate seed runs twice and the trace digests
// must match; the seeds together must reach every outcome class the simulator
// can produce, remap judgements included, so a thin run fails instead of
// passing quietly. Nightly: STACKI_SIMULATOR_SEEDS raises the seed count (up to
// SEEDS_MAX) without changing the gate; spike.bench.ts reports the judgements.
