// The document actor (plan §2 layer 2, §5.2), as pure steps. One actor per
// canonical file. Each call does one unit of the write protocol and returns the
// next state plus what happened; whoever drives it — the simulator's seeded
// scheduler, or the Electron host (electron/documentActors.ts) — decides what
// runs between two steps. Disk I/O, parsing and hashing are injected, so this
// module has no clock, no timer, no promise and no OS (plan §10), and the
// simulator exercises exactly the state machine that ships.
//
//   idle    → read, refresh the snapshot, plan, verify witnesses, apply in
//             memory, re-parse the candidate           (§5.2 steps 1–6)
//   planned → take the advisory lock, re-read, re-verify, atomic replace
//                                                      (§5.2 steps 7–8)
//   written → re-read, verify the checksum, release the lock, commit
//                                                      (§5.2 steps 9–10)
//
// Honest limit, a product contract (plan §5.2): a byte check cannot close the
// kernel's check-to-use race against an uncooperative writer, because no
// portable API offers compare-and-swap on a pathname. The lock excludes only
// cooperating writers (another Stacki). So this actor never knowingly applies an
// intent to stale bytes — it re-reads and re-verifies under the lock — never
// silently remaps an anchor — mapping is the planner's, and ambiguity rejects —
// and reports `write-race` where the OS cannot guarantee atomicity: when the
// bytes read back after the replace are not the candidate's.
//
// The actor never retries and never merges: every accepted intent reaches
// exactly one terminal outcome (plan §3.5), and a rejected one needs a
// deliberate resubmission by the persistence layer.
