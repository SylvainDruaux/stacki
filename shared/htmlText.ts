// `<p>&copy;&#160;{SITE_NAME}</p>` renders as "© Remarkable". The navigator drew
// the row as `&copy;`, the Content field offered `&#160;` to edit, and both were
// showing the source's spelling of a character rather than the character. An
// editor over a rendered page has to say what the page says.
//
// So a text node holds the characters, and the file keeps its own spelling: an
// untouched node is written back exactly as it was found (the writer has the
// original to hand), and one that has been edited is written as its characters,
// with the three that would otherwise be markup put back into entities.
//
// It lives in shared/ because both processes need the same rule: the parser
// reads a text node's value with it, and the Content field has to emit values
// the parser will hand back unchanged. Every save echoes through the parser,
// and an echo that differs from what the field emitted rewrites the field
// mid-keystroke, sending the caret to the start of the line.
