# Enforcement

AGENTS.md states the rules; this page says which machine holds each one, so a reader can tell a
rule that cannot be broken from one that relies on review. Everything below runs the same way for
a person, for Claude Code, for Codex, and for Pi, because every gate calls the same code.

## Gates

| Gate | When | What runs | Can it be skipped? |
|---|---|---|---|
| Agent pre-tool | Before an agent runs a command or edits a file | `scripts/agent/core.mts` verdicts | No: refusals come from the harness |
| Agent post-tool | After an agent edits a file | Prettier (writes), policy scan, ESLint on the file | No |
| Agent stop | When an agent tries to finish | Prettier check, scan, ESLint on every changed file, then `tsc` | After 3 refusals for the same findings the session may end, and the human is told; new findings start a new round |
| `pre-commit` | `git commit` | Prettier check, scan, ESLint on staged files | `--no-verify`, which agent hooks refuse |
| `commit-msg` | `git commit` | Typed subject ≤ 72 characters, blank line, body | As above |
| `pre-push` | `git push` | `tsc`, full ESLint, full scan | As above |
| CI (`npm test`) | Every pull request and push to `main` | Builds, `tsc` (app and scripts), ESLint, Prettier, scan, every test | **No**, once `main` requires the `Check` workflow |

The adapters are thin: `.claude/settings.json` and `.codex/hooks.json` call
`scripts/agent/{claude,codex}.mts`; `.pi/extensions/stacki-policy/` imports the same modules. Git
hooks live in `.githooks/` and are installed by `npm install` (`scripts/policy/install-git-hooks.mts`).

Commands for people and agents:

- `npm run check:changed` — what the stop hook runs. Use it before you finish.
- `npm run check:policy` — the repository policy scan.
- `npm run lint`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run format` — the individual tools.
- `env -u ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE npm test` — the full gate CI runs.

### The gate files

Some files define the gates themselves: `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `eslint.config.mjs`, the
Prettier config, every `tsconfig*.json`, `scripts/{eslint-plugin,policy,agent}/`, `.githooks/`,
the agent configs, `.github/workflows/`, `shared/core/limits.ts`, and this page. An agent that edits one
— with an edit tool, or with a shell command that writes it — is stopped for a human decision:
Claude Code asks; Codex and Pi refuse and tell the agent to ask. A human who starts an agent with
`STACKI_ALLOW_POLICY_EDITS=1` has approved such edits for that session (the agent cannot set it:
hooks run in the harness's environment, not the agent's shell).

The shell check is a heuristic — a shell can write a file in more ways than any list names — and
the agent hooks are guard rails, not a sandbox. CI is the gate that cannot be argued with.

## Rule map

**Mechanism:** `tsc` = compiler flag; `lint` = ESLint (`stacki/…` rules live in
`scripts/eslint-plugin/`); `scan` = `scripts/policy/scan.mts`; `hook` = agent or git hook;
`review` = people, because no deterministic check exists.

### Non-negotiables

| # | Rule | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | No `any` | lint: `no-explicit-any`, `no-unsafe-*` (assignment, member access, call, return, argument) |
| 2 | No type assertions outside validated constructors | lint: `no-restricted-syntax` (assertion syntax), off only in `shared/` and four named adapters |
| 3 | No `enum` | lint: `stacki/no-enum` |
| 4 | No `Partial<T>` inputs | lint: `stacki/no-partial-parameter` |
| 5 | Boundaries parse before use | lint: `no-unsafe-*` keep `JSON.parse`'s `any` from flowing anywhere; review for parser quality |
| 6 | Immutability by default | lint: `prefer-readonly`, `no-param-reassign` (with properties; exempt only for DOM elements, React refs, canvas contexts, and style declarations, by name); review for `readonly` types |
| 7 | Total functions | tsc: `strict`, `noImplicitReturns`, `noUncheckedIndexedAccess`; review |
| 8 | Two error channels | lint: `only-throw-error`, `no-floating-promises`, `no-misused-promises`; review for channel choice |
| 9 | A limit on everything | lint: `stacki/no-unbounded-loop`, `stacki/bounded-recursion`; review for queues and caches |
| 10 | Assert invariants | scan: assertion density in `shared/` (floor in `scripts/policy/limits.mts`); lint: `stacki/no-compound-assert` |

### Configuration

| Rule | Mechanism |
|---|---|
| Required tsconfig flags | tsc: every `tsconfig*.json`; `scripts/tsconfig.json` adds `verbatimModuleSyntax` for scripts |
| Required ESLint rules | lint: `eslint.config.mjs` is the source of truth |
| Prettier, width 100 | scan: `line-width` (hard limit, code and config); CI: `prettier --check` |

### Core patterns

| § | Rule | Mechanism |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Exhaustive unions | lint: `switch-exhaustiveness-check`; tsc: `never` checks |
| 2 | Parse, don't validate | lint (`no-unsafe-*`); tests: one parse test per contract (review) |
| 3 | `catch` binds `unknown` | lint: `stacki/catch-unknown`, `use-unknown-in-catch-callback-variable` |
| 3 | All errors handled | lint: `no-floating-promises`, `no-misused-promises` |
| 4 | Branded lookalikes | review |
| 5 | Constants as types | review |
| 6 | No boolean parameters | lint: `stacki/no-boolean-parameter` (inline callbacks and one-flag setters exempt) |
| 6 | `undefined` for absence | lint: `stacki/no-null` (fixed list of platform calls exempt) |
| 6 | Callbacks last | lint: `stacki/callback-last` |
| 6 | Explicit options at call sites | review |
| 8 | No overloads | lint: `stacki/no-overloads` |
| 9 | Split compound assertions | lint: `stacki/no-compound-assert` |
| 9 | Paired assertions | review |
| 10 | Bounded loops and recursion | lint: `stacki/no-unbounded-loop`, `stacki/bounded-recursion` (direct recursion; mutual recursion is review) |
| 11 | 70 lines per function | lint: `max-lines-per-function` |
| 11 | Braces always | lint: `curly` |
| 11 | Simple, positive conditions | review |
| 12 | No abbreviations | lint: `stacki/naming` (word list in `eslint.config.mjs`) |
| 12 | Qualifiers last | lint: `stacki/naming` (`max`/`min` before a quantity) |
| 12 | Good names, one meaning | review |
| 13 | Comments are sentences | lint: `stacki/comment-sentence` (own-line comments: capital, full stop) |
| 13 | Test files open with goal and method | scan: `test-header` (the comment's presence; its content is review) |
| 13 | Every suppression says why | lint: `stacki/require-disable-reason`; scan: `no-blanket-disable` |
| 14 | Division states its rounding | lint: `stacki/division-intent` (where the result is an index or count) |
| 14 | Index, count, size brands | review |
| 15 | Performance | review |
| 16 | File order | review |
| 16 | Renderer layers and feature edges; main-process areas | lint: `stacki/source-layers` (`SOURCE_LAYERS`, `ELECTRON_AREAS` in `eslint.config.mjs`) |
| 12, 16 | Layout names: camelCase folders and modules, PascalCase components, unique per root | scan: `layout-name`, `layout-unique` |
| 17 | Dependencies justified | scan: `dependency-record` (`docs/dependencies.md` ↔ `package.json`) |
| 17 | One lockfile | scan: `one-lockfile` |
| 17 | Scripts are TypeScript | scan: `no-shell-script` |
| 17 | Descriptive commit messages | hook: `commit-msg` |
| — | No `@ts-nocheck`; `@ts-expect-error` says why | scan: `no-ts-nocheck`; lint: `ban-ts-comment` |

## Changing a rule

1. Change the rule where it lives (the table above says where), with its test:
   `test/contracts/eslint-plugin.test.ts`, `policy-scan.test.ts`, or `agent-policy.test.ts`.
2. Update this page and AGENTS.md in the same commit.
3. The commit touches gate files, so an agent needs a human's approval to make it.
