# Dependencies

AGENTS.md §17: every dependency carries a written justification — what it does, why the platform
can't, and what it costs. `scripts/policy/scan.mts` holds this file to `package.json`: every
entry in `dependencies` and `devDependencies` must have a `### \`name\`` heading here, and every
heading must name a declared dependency. Adding a package without a paragraph fails the gate;
removing one without deleting its paragraph fails it too.

Each entry answers three questions: **Does** (what it does for Stacki), **Why not the platform**
(what Node, Electron, or the browser lacks), and **Cost** (install weight, risk, or lock-in).

## Runtime (`dependencies`)

### `@astrojs/compiler`

**Does:** parses `.astro` files into the AST the page tree is built from (`electron/parse/astroParser.ts`).
**Why not the platform:** Astro's grammar (frontmatter, expressions, components) has no platform
parser; this is the reference implementation. **Cost:** WASM payload; its AST shape is a contract we
pin with round-trip tests.

### `@codemirror/autocomplete`, `@codemirror/commands`, `@codemirror/lang-css`, `@codemirror/lang-html`, `@codemirror/lang-javascript`, `@codemirror/lang-markdown`, `@codemirror/language`, `@codemirror/search`, `@codemirror/state`, `@codemirror/view`, `codemirror`

**Does:** the code editor panels (source, CSS, frontmatter). **Why not the platform:** a
`<textarea>` has no syntax model, incremental parsing, or transactions. **Cost:** the largest
renderer dependency family; split per language so only what is used ships.

### `@lezer/highlight`, `@lezer/javascript`

**Does:** syntax-highlight tags for the editors, and the JavaScript parser behind `src/features/props/jsCheck.ts`.
**Why not the platform:** no incremental JS parser exists in the browser. **Cost:** small; already
a transitive dependency of CodeMirror, declared because we import it directly.

### `@shikijs/core`, `@shikijs/engine-javascript`, `@shikijs/langs`, `@shikijs/themes`

**Does:** read-only Astro highlighting (`src/ui/astroHighlight.ts`) matching Astro's own output.
**Why not the platform:** TextMate grammars need an engine; the JavaScript engine avoids WASM.
**Cost:** grammar and theme payloads; imported per language.

### `@uiw/react-codemirror`

**Does:** the React binding for CodeMirror. **Why not the platform:** lifecycle glue between React
state and CodeMirror transactions. **Cost:** thin wrapper; replaceable by a local hook if it lags.

### `@xterm/addon-fit`, `@xterm/xterm`

**Does:** the integrated terminal renderer. **Why not the platform:** no terminal emulator exists in
the browser. **Cost:** renderer weight; paired with `node-pty`.

### `electron-updater`

**Does:** in-app updates from GitHub releases. **Why not the platform:** Electron's `autoUpdater`
lacks the GitHub provider and differential downloads. **Cost:** runs with network access in main;
its inputs are release metadata we publish.

### `known-css-properties`

**Does:** the list of valid CSS property names for the style panel. **Why not the platform:**
`CSS.supports` answers per value, not "list every property", and differs by engine. **Cost:** a
data file; no code.

### `node-pty`

**Does:** spawns the terminal's pseudo-terminal. **Why not the platform:** Node's `child_process`
has no PTY. **Cost:** native module — the reason for `fix:install` and `afterPack` handling.

### `postcss`, `postcss-selector-parser`

**Does:** parses and rewrites stylesheets and selectors for the style panel. **Why not the
platform:** CSSOM drops comments and formatting, and edits must preserve the author's source.
**Cost:** moderate; parsing happens in the renderer on user-sized files.

### `react`, `react-dom`

**Does:** the renderer UI. **Why not the platform:** the whole UI is built on it. **Cost:** the
framework choice; pinned to the 18 line.

### `smol-toml`

**Does:** reads TOML content files (`electron/content/formats/toml.ts`). **Why not the platform:** no TOML
parser in Node. **Cost:** small, dependency-free.

### `typescript`

**Does:** at runtime, the compiler API reads component property types
(`electron/property*.ts`); at build time, it compiles the project. **Why not the platform:** no
TypeScript type-checker exists outside it. **Cost:** large install; required at runtime, so it
stays in `dependencies`.

### `yaml`

**Does:** frontmatter and YAML content files, keeping comments and formatting on round trip. **Why
not the platform:** no YAML parser in Node. **Cost:** moderate; its document API is what makes
lossless edits possible.

## Development (`devDependencies`)

### `@astrojs/compiler-rs`

**Does:** the Astro 7+ compiler, exercised by tests that pin behavior across both compilers. **Why
not the platform:** as for `@astrojs/compiler`. **Cost:** native binary; tests only.

### `@types/node`, `@types/react`, `@types/react-dom`

**Does:** type declarations for Node and React. **Why not the platform:** neither ships its own
types. **Cost:** none at runtime.

### `@typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin`, `@typescript-eslint/parser`, `@typescript-eslint/utils`

**Does:** type-aware lint rules and the TypeScript parser for ESLint; `scripts/eslintPlugin/`
builds on the AST and rule types from `utils` (type-only imports, same release line as the
parser, so the node shapes the rules see are the ones they were written against). **Why not the platform:** `tsc` has no policy rules (no-unsafe-*,
exhaustiveness). **Cost:** lint time; about 80 s for a full run.

### `@typescript-eslint/rule-tester`

**Does:** runs the local plugin's rule tests (`test/contracts/eslint-plugin.test.ts`) under
`node:test`. **Why not the platform:** ESLint's own `RuleTester` is typed for ESLint's rule shape,
not typescript-eslint's, so the tests would need type assertions (AGENTS.md non-negotiable 2).
**Cost:** tests only; same release line as the parser.

### `@vitejs/plugin-react`

**Does:** JSX transform and fast refresh for Vite. **Why not the platform:** browsers do not run
JSX. **Cost:** build-time only.

### `concurrently`, `wait-on`

**Does:** the `dev` script: runs Vite and Electron together, and waits for the dev server port.
**Why not the platform:** npm scripts have no cross-platform process orchestration. **Cost:**
dev-only; candidates to fold into one TypeScript script, as the dev server URL already was
(`scripts/build/devElectron.ts`).

### `electron`

**Does:** the application runtime. **Why not the platform:** it is the platform. **Cost:** large
download; version pins the Chromium and Node the app ships with.

### `electron-builder`

**Does:** packages, signs, and notarizes releases. **Why not the platform:** Electron ships no
packager. **Cost:** large tree; release-time only.

### `eslint`

**Does:** the linter (AGENTS.md §17: one linter). **Why not the platform:** `tsc` checks types, not
policy. **Cost:** lint time.

### `eslint-plugin-react-hooks`

**Does:** enforces the rules of hooks and effect dependencies. **Why not the platform:** these are
React invariants the compiler cannot see. **Cost:** small.

### `jsdom`

**Does:** a DOM for renderer tests under Node. **Why not the platform:** Node has no DOM. **Cost:**
large tree; tests only.

### `prettier`

**Does:** the formatter (AGENTS.md §17: one formatter; `printWidth: 100`). **Why not the
platform:** no formatter ships with Node or TypeScript. **Cost:** dependency-free; pinned to an
exact version because a formatter upgrade reformats code, and that must be a deliberate commit.

### `vite`

**Does:** the renderer dev server and production bundler. **Why not the platform:** browsers load
modules but do not bundle, transform TSX, or hot-reload. **Cost:** build-time only.
