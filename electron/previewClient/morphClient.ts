// Astro renders components on the server, so Vite cannot hot-swap one: any
// edit ends in "reload the document". A reload restarts every CSS animation,
// rewinds every video, drops scroll position and closes whatever was open —
// in an editor, that is the state you were looking at when you made the edit.
// The dev plugin catches that reload and sends a message here instead.
//
// What arrives is a NEW server rendering of the page. The obvious thing is to
// diff it against the live DOM, and that is wrong: the live DOM is not the
// server's to command. A slider has cloned its slides, a menu has set
// aria-expanded, an analytics tag has appended an iframe. Diffing against the
// live DOM treats all of that as content the server deleted, and removes it.
//
// So the diff is between the server's PREVIOUS rendering and its new one, and
// only that difference is applied to the live page. Anything the client did
// appears in neither rendering, so nothing here has an opinion about it, and
// it survives untouched. Three trees, and the live one is only ever written
// where the other two disagree.

// This module is the client's entry: fetching renderings, update() and the
// two ways the news arrives. It and the modules it imports reach the browser
// as one module's text: main reads the bundle (scripts/build/bundleClients.ts)
// and hands it to the dev plugin as virtual:avb-morph, which has no folder for
// an import to resolve against.
