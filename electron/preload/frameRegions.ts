// <!--avb-s:path--> / <!--avb-e:path--> comment pairs. Record each pair's
// run of sibling DOM nodes, then take the markers out.
//
// Comments, not elements: a <template> counts for :nth-child, :first-child,
// + and ~ like anything else, so the markers this replaced shifted the
// page's own structural selectors for as long as they were in the DOM —
// through first paint, since they can only be removed once the run has been
// recorded. A comment is invisible to all of those. A node in a named slot
// is marked the same way: its markers have to carry the `slot` attribute to
// travel with it, and a <Fragment slot="…" set:html> carries the attribute
// while putting nothing but the comment in the slot.
//
// A <template> is still READ as a marker below. Nothing writes one any more,
// but a page served by a dev server that started before this app was updated
// still has them, and a canvas that suddenly could not read its own markers
