// The document actors of one Electron main process (plan §2 layer 2, §5.2): one
// actor per canonical file, driven by this host. From step 5 every write of
// project text is an intent submitted here, so the actor is the only writer,
// and every `applied` outcome hands the new checksum back for the persistence
// layer to adopt as its next baseline (plan §5.2). Since step 10 every write is
// splices: a page's edits are planned intents, and a program's change to a
// file's text (a stylesheet, a CMS entry, a property batch) is its diff from
// the bytes it read, a `rewrite-text` — no intent replaces a whole file.
//
// Scheduling. Main's IPC handlers run one at a time to completion on one
// thread, and so does this host: a submission is stepped to its terminal
// outcome before the call returns, the actor's steps back to back. That keeps
// the check-to-use window as narrow as the protocol allows and the write order
// the legacy order. The actor's queue is still the bound — a re-entrant or
// deferred submission queues behind the running one, and a full queue answers
// `backpressured` (tests drive the deferred mode to prove it). The actor never
// sees a timer: the only one here is the watcher-tick refresh, injected.
//
// Batches (component:editProperties, plan §3.3): the involved actors are leased
// in sorted canonical order, each file witnessed by its `before` checksum. With
// one thread two batches cannot interleave today; the sorted order is what
// keeps them from deadlocking once acquisition can wait.
