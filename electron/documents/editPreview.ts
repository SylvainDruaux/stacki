// what the edits would have written: splices of the origin, never a reprint of
// the file (the no-whole-file-regeneration rule, eslint.config.mjs). Kept, that
// text is saved as a code patch of whatever the disk holds now (plan §3.6).

// and planning with nothing between authored and current is the planner's
