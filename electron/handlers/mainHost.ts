// What the IPC handler modules use of main.ts: the registrar, the window's
// channel and dialogs, the open project, and the document actors. main.ts owns
// all of it (it holds the window and the module-level state), builds one host,
// and hands each module the part it declares as a Pick of this interface.
//
// Handler modules never import electron's values: the main harness
// (test/helpers/mainHarness.ts) replaces electron for main.js alone, so a
// module that imported it would reach the real one.
