// against @astrojs/compiler: kept at the top level and inside elements,
// stripped in slot content. Where a plain comment wouldn't survive, the same
// comment goes in as raw html through a Fragment, which renders nothing of
// its own — so what lands in the DOM is still just a comment.
//
// A marker for a node in a NAMED slot has to carry the `slot` attribute, or it
// lands in the default slot while the node it marks renders in the named one —
// and an attribute needs something to sit on. A <template> was that something
// for a while, and a <template> is an element: it counts for :nth-child,
// :first-child, + and ~, and it sits in the page between the slot's real
// children until the canvas takes it out again. Which is the whole thing
// comments were chosen to avoid, reintroduced in the one place nobody looks.
//
// A <Fragment> takes attributes and renders no element of its own, so it can
// carry both the slot and the comment: what lands in that slot is a comment
// and nothing else.

    : `<!--avb-${kind}:${path}-->`;

// `inSlot` says this node is a direct child of a component, i.e. slot content —
// which decides how the marker has to be written, since Astro's compiler drops
// a plain html comment there.
//
// Every element and component also carries its path as an attribute, which is
// the marker that survives what happens to the page after Astro is done with
// it. A component doesn't have to render `<slot />` and leave it at that: it
// can render the slot to a string and put the string back with `set:html`,
// which is how it asks "did my slot render anything?" — and the usual way to
// answer is to drop html comments before looking, since a comment is content
// that isn't:
//
//   const content = await slots.render('default');
//   return content.replace(/<!--[\s\S]*?-->/g, '').trim();  // ← markers gone
//
// Nothing on the page then answers to those paths. The navigator reported
// every row inside such a component as rendering nothing, on a page where they
// were plainly on screen, and nothing in there could be clicked or outlined.
//
// It can't be narrowed to slot content, either: what is being scrubbed is
// everything the slot rendered, which includes the output of every component
// inside it. <Tabs> written at the top of its own file, its markers a page
// away from any slot, still lost every one of them for being placed inside a
// <Section>. So the path rides on the markup everywhere — as the same
// `data-avb-p` the collector writes at runtime, and invisible to :nth-child,
// :first-child, + and ~ in a way a marker node could never be.
//
// On a component the attribute is a prop, and reaching the DOM is then up to
// that component — which is why every file's own ROOT elements carry whatever
// name they were called by, alongside their own (`atRoot`). Waiting for the
// author to spread `{...rest}` was not good enough: a slider written without
// one, placed in a <Section> that scrubs comments, had no marker left and no
// attribute either, so nothing on the page answered to it. The navigator
// showed it as rendering nothing while it was plainly on screen, it drew no
// outline, and it could not be clicked.
//
// The markers stay either way: they are what works when nothing interferes,
// they say where a node ENDS, and they carry the nodes an attribute can't
// (text, a loop, a branch).

  // Everything else that can hold an attribute — a component — gets the comment

  // whose components read a slot by rendering it to a string and scrubbing the
  // comments out (a common way to ask "did my slot render anything?"), that
  // comment is scrubbed with them — and the path still arrives, because the
