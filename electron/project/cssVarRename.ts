//
// A custom property's name is not kept anywhere but in the text: it is the
// declaration `--brand: …` and every `var(--brand)` that reads it, spread across
// however many stylesheets and components the project has. So a rename is one
// substitution over all of them, and it either happens everywhere or the name is
// silently broken somewhere the panel cannot show.
//
// Groups are not stored either — the panel derives them from shared name
// prefixes (see prefixSections), so renaming a group is renaming each of its
// members. Both arrive here as a list of renames applied in a single pass, which
// is also what makes a swap (`a`→`b`, `b`→`a`) come out right instead of
// collapsing into one name.

// Where a name can be written. CSS files hold most of them; an Astro component
// keeps its rules in a `<style>` block, and a `style="--x: 1"` can sit in markup
// or a template — a token spelled `--x` in any of these is that variable.

 * in a layout, a `--x` in a Tailwind or Astro config at the root, a themed
 * string in a helper module. So this walks the project rather than those three
 * roots, and skips only what is not the project's own text (dependencies, build

 * resolving somewhere the panel cannot see, which is the failure that has no
